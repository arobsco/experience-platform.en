# Explore an advertising system using the Flow Service API

Flow Service is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the Flow Service API to explore advertising systems.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Sources](../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
*   [Sandboxes](../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to an advertising system using the Flow Service API.

### Gather required credentials

This tutorial requires you to have a valid connection with the third-party advertising application you wish to ingest data from. A valid connection involves your application's connection specification ID and connection ID. More information about creating an advertising connection and retrieving these values can be found in the [connect an advertising source to Platform](../../api/create/advertising/ads.md) tutorial.

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to Platform APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](../../../../tutorials/authentication.md). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

*   Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
*   x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
*   x-gw-ims-org-id: `{IMS_ORG}`

All resources in Experience Platform, including those belonging to Flow Service, are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

*   x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

*   Content-Type: `application/json`

## Explore your data tables

Using the base connection for your advertising system, you can explore your data tables by performing GET requests. Use the following call to find the path of the table you wish to inspect or ingest into Platform.

**API format**

```https
GET /connections/{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}/explore?objectType=root
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}` | The ID of the base connection for your advertising system. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'http://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/2484f2df-c057-4ab5-84f2-dfc0577ab592/explore?objectType=root' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response is an array of tables from to your advertising system. Find the table you wish to bring into Platform and take note of its `path` property, as you are required to provide it in the next step to inspect its structure.

```json
[
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "v201809.ACCOUNT_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "path": "v201809.ACCOUNT_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "v201809.ADGROUP_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "path": "v201809.ADGROUP_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "v201809.AD_CUSTOMIZERS_FEED_ITEM_REPORT",
        "path": "v201809.AD_CUSTOMIZERS_FEED_ITEM_REPORT",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "v201809.AD_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "path": "v201809.AD_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    }
]
```

## Inspect the structure of a table

To inspect the structure of a table from your advertising system, perform a GET request while specifying the path of a table as a query parameter.

**API format**

```http
GET /connections/{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}/explore?objectType=table&object={TABLE_PATH}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}` | The connection ID for your advertising system. |
| `{TABLE_PATH}` | The path of a table within your advertising system. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'http://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/2484f2df-c057-4ab5-84f2-dfc0577ab592/explore?objectType=table&object=v201809.AD_PERFORMANCE_REPORT' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the structure of a table. Details regarding each of the table's columns are located within elements of the `columns` array.

```json
{
    "format": "flat",
    "schema": {
        "columns": [
            {
                "name": "CallOnlyPhoneNumber",
                "type": "string",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "AdGroupId",
                "type": "long",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "minimum": -9007199254740992,
                    "maximum": 9007199254740991
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "AdGroupName",
                "type": "string",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Date",
                "type": "string",
                "meta:xdmType": "date-time",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "format": "date-time"
                }
            },
        ]
    }
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have explored your advertising system, found the path of the table you wish to bring in to Platform, and obtained information regarding its structure. You can use this information in the next tutorial to [collect data from your advertising system and bring it into Platform](../collect/advertising.md).
